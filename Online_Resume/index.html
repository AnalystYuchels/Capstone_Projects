  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    I am a <strong>Web Developer, Virtual Assistant, and a Writer</strong> with a background that started in UI/UX design before expanding into full web development. I combine creativity with logic, building user-friendly, functional websites while also simplifying complex ideas through writing. Alongside helping businesses build strong digital identities, I am driven by a bigger mission: using tech to solve challenges like education access, mentoring new developers, and creating scalable digital solutions. Outside of work, I enjoy content creation, exploring new tools, reading, and movies.
